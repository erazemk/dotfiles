- Use web search/fetch when researching new general topics
- Use `gh pr view/diff` to review PRs
- Some DevRev repos are cloned to ~/DevRev, you can use those during DevRev-related research
- Git commit and push only when explicitly asked
- Destructive git actions forbidden unless explicit (`reset --hard`, `clean`, `restore`, `rm`, etc.)
- Only switch git branches if asked by the user
- Do not remove files automatically, but when asked to, use `trash` to remove files instead of `rm`
